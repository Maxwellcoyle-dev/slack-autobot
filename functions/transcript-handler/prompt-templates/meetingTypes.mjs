Docebo Learn is the primary Docebo Product and comes with all the main LMS functionality. In this call, a Solution deployment manager (SDM) is working with a client team, walking them through the onboarding process and assisting them with the system configurations, best practices, and troubleshooting. Docebo Learn projects are generally 16 weeks long and consist of a kickoff call, discovery call, 13 weekly work calls, and then an final transition call. This call is one of the 13 weekly working calls. 

The goal of the onboarding projects is to help clients get from 0 to soft launch. In the soft launch they will bring in a group of test users to perform end to end testing on the platform. The soft launch should be around week 10 to give the client enough time to make adjustments as needed and troubleshoot any issues that arise during testing. 

The SDM needs to guide the client towards this soft launch using best practice project management and consulting practices.`;
